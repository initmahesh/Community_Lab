## Lab Overview

This lab is divided into **5 phases**:

### Phase 1: Building a Simple Market Research Agent

In this phase, we will build a simple flow with a market research agent that conducts comprehensive market research based on user queries. The agent will analyze competitors, pricing, features, and market opportunities in the AI legal tech space.

### Phase 2: Building an Orchestration Flow

In this phase, we will create an orchestration flow where, based on the user query, the agent intelligently decides which specialized agent to call‚Äîeither the **user research agent** or the **market research agent**. This demonstrates advanced agent routing and decision-making capabilities.

### Phase 3: Adding PRD Generation, Feedback System, Widgets, and Drive Integration

In this phase, we will:

- Implement a **feedback system** where users can approve research content generated by the agent
- Add a **PRD Agent** to convert research data into structured Product Requirements Documents
- Integrate the **Zapier MCP server** to automatically save the PRD to the user's Google Drive
- Create **output widgets** to enhance the agent's response display

### Phase 4: PRD Agent - Detailed Configuration Reference

This phase provides the complete detailed configuration reference for the **PRD (Product Requirements Document) Agent** that was integrated in Phase 3. It includes the full PRD Agent prompt and configuration recommendations for converting market and user research into structured product requirements.

### Phase 5: Integrating a Custom Frontend

In this final phase, we will connect the agent to a **custom frontend website** using ChatKit, allowing you to deploy the agent with a fully customized user interface.

---

## Phase 2: Building an Orchestration Flow with Agent Routing

In this phase, we will create an orchestration that routes user queries to the appropriate specialized agent. Based on the user's input, the orchestrator will decide whether to call the **Market Research Agent** or a **User Research Agent**.

![Configure Agent](./images/phase2.png)

### Flow Diagram

```
User Query
    ‚Üì
Orchestrator Agent
    ‚Üì
If-Else Component
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí (if "user_research") ‚Üí User Research Agent ‚Üí Response
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí (else) ‚Üí Market Research Agent ‚Üí Response
```

## Step 1: Configure Orchestrator Agent

As you can see in the image below, we will be having 3 agents:

- **Orchestrator Agent**
- **Market Research Agent**
- **User Research Agent**

![Configure Agent](./images/phase2.png)

First, configure the orchestrator agent with the following prompt:

```
# Role
You are a Query Routing Orchestrator. Your job is to analyze incoming user queries and route them to the appropriate research agent based on the query's intent and context.

# Your Task
Carefully analyze each user query and determine whether it should be handled by:
1. **Market Research Agent** - for queries about markets, industries, and competition
2. **User Research Agent** - for queries about users, customers, and their behavior

# Classification Guidelines

## Route to MARKET RESEARCH AGENT when the query involves:
- Market size, TAM (Total Addressable Market), or market potential
- Industry trends, forecasts, or projections
- Competitive analysis or competitor intelligence
- Market segmentation or target market identification
- Pricing strategies or market pricing analysis
- Market entry strategies or expansion opportunities
- Industry regulations or compliance landscape
- Market share analysis
- Economic factors affecting the market
- Supply chain or distribution channels
- Partnership or vendor landscape
- Technology trends in the industry
- Market barriers or challenges

Keywords: market, industry, competitors, pricing, trends, forecast, TAM, SAM, landscape, sector, economy, regulation

## Route to USER RESEARCH AGENT when the query involves:
- User behavior, patterns, or habits
- Customer feedback, reviews, or testimonials
- User personas or customer profiles
- User needs, pain points, or problems
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT, NPS scores)
- User journey or experience mapping
- Feature requests or product feedback
- User demographics or psychographics
- Churn analysis or retention insights
- User engagement or adoption metrics
- Usability issues or UX concerns
- Customer preferences or expectations
- User testing results or insights
- Onboarding effectiveness
- Support tickets or customer complaints

Keywords: user, customer, feedback, behavior, persona, satisfaction, churn, engagement, UX, pain points, needs, journey

# Decision Rules for Ambiguous Cases

When a query contains elements of BOTH market and user research:
- If asking about "market demand" or "market opportunity" ‚Üí Market Research
- If asking about "user demand" or "user needs" ‚Üí User Research
- If asking about "what competitors are doing" ‚Üí Market Research
- If asking about "what users are doing" ‚Üí User Research
- If the query mentions external market forces ‚Üí Market Research
- If the query mentions internal customer data ‚Üí User Research
- **When truly ambiguous, default to User Research Agent** (better to be specific about existing users than general about markets)

# Output Format

You MUST respond with ONLY ONE of these exact values:
- "market_research"
- "user_research"

Do NOT add any explanation, reasoning, or additional text. Output only the routing decision.

# Examples

**Query:** "What's the market size for AI-powered CRM tools?"
**Output:** market_research

**Query:** "Why are users abandoning our onboarding flow?"
**Output:** user_research

**Query:** "What are competitors charging for similar features?"
**Output:** market_research

**Query:** "What features are users requesting most?"
**Output:** user_research

**Query:** "How do users feel about our pricing?"
**Output:** user_research

**Query:** "What's the competitive landscape in Europe?"
**Output:** market_research

**Query:** "Show me customer churn trends"
**Output:** user_research

**Query:** "What are industry best practices?"
**Output:** market_research

**Query:** "What pain points do customers have?"
**Output:** user_research

**Query:** "What are the growth opportunities?"
**Output:** user_research
(Default to user research when ambiguous - focuses on user-driven opportunities)

# Remember
- Be decisive - make a clear choice between the two options
- Focus on PRIMARY intent, not secondary aspects
- When genuinely uncertain, choose User Research
- Output ONLY "market_research" or "user_research" - nothing else

```

## Step 2: Add If-Else Component

Add an if-else component to route the user query based on the orchestrator agent's response:

**If condition:**

```
if orchestrator_agent_response == "user_research"
    ‚Üí Route to User Research Agent
else
    ‚Üí Route to Market Research Agent
```

![Configure Agent](./images/ifelse.gif)

**Instead of asking:** "Which user segment?"
**Do this:** Analyze all users or break down by major segments if relevant

**Instead of asking:** "What metrics matter most to you?"
**Do this:** Include the most critical metrics for that type of query (retention, satisfaction, engagement)

# Common Query Types & How to Handle Them

**"Why are users churning?"**
‚Üí Analyze churn data by cohort, look for patterns in user journey, review exit surveys, check usage drop-off points. Assume recent time period if not specified.

**"What features do users want?"**
‚Üí Review feature requests, survey data, support tickets, competitor comparisons users mention. Prioritize by frequency and impact.

**"How satisfied are users with [feature/product]?"**
‚Üí Check NPS/CSAT scores, analyze reviews and feedback, look at usage metrics and engagement. If feature not specified, analyze overall product satisfaction.

**"What are the biggest user pain points?"**
‚Üí Analyze support tickets, review negative feedback, identify common complaints, assess severity and frequency across all touchpoints.

**"How are users actually using [feature]?"**
‚Üí Query analytics for usage patterns, session recordings, feature adoption rates, user flows. If feature unclear, analyze top features.

**"What do users think about our pricing?"**
‚Üí Review feedback on pricing, analyze upgrade/downgrade patterns, check price objections in sales/support data.

**"Who are our most engaged users?"**
‚Üí Segment by usage frequency, feature adoption, tenure, create power user personas with clear characteristics.

**"What's causing low adoption of [feature]?"**
‚Üí Check discovery metrics, analyze onboarding flow, review usability feedback, compare to similar features. If feature unspecified, identify features with lowest adoption.

### Flow Diagram

```
User Query
    ‚Üì
Orchestrator Agent
    ‚Üì
If-Else Component
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí (if "user_research") ‚Üí User Research Agent
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí (else) ‚Üí Market Research Agent
                    ‚Üì
            Set Variable (research_data)
                    ‚Üì
            User Approval Component
                    ‚Üì
            (if approved) ‚Üí PRD Agent
                    ‚Üì
            Set Variable (final_response)
                    ‚Üì
            Zapier Agent (MCP Server)
                    ‚Üì
            Save PRD to Google Drive
                    ‚Üì
            Display with Widget
```

## Step 1: Copy Phase 2 Flow

1. Navigate to your Phase 2 orchestration flow
2. Copy the entire flow (Orchestrator Agent ‚Üí If-Else Component ‚Üí User Research Agent / Market Research Agent)
3. This will serve as the base for adding feedback and integration features

![Configure Agent](./images/phase2.png)

## Step 2: Add Set Variable Component

Add a **Set Variable** component to store the research output:

1. After the agent response (either User Research Agent or Market Research Agent)
2. Add a Set Variable component
3. In the value field, store the agent response with the variable name: `research_data`

![Configure Agent](./images/setstate.gif)

## Step 3: Add User Approval Component

Add a **User Approval** component to get user feedback:

1. After the Set Variable component
2. Add a User Approval component
3. This will allow users to approve or reject the agent's response before proceeding

![Configure Agent](./images/userapproval.png)

## Step 4: Configure Zapier Agent with MCP Server

On the approval side, add a Zapier agent to save approved content to Google Drive:

1. Add a new agent called "Tool Calling Agent"
2. In the **Tools** section, click on **MCP**
   ![Configure Agent](./images/addingmcpserver.png)
   ![Configure Agent](./images/img-4.gif)
3. Configure the Zapier MCP server:
   - You will need a Zapier API key
   - Connect your Zapier account
     ![Configure Agent](./images/img-7.png)
4. Set up the **Google Drive** tool on the Zapier side as well
5. Add the **Google Drive** tool
6. Select **Create File from Text** action
   ![Configure Agent](./images/img-6.gif)
7. Come back to the flow and provide your API key
8. From the approve section dropdown, select **Never**
   ![Configure Agent](./images/img-8.png)

## Step 5: Configure Instructions and Context

1. In the **Instructions** section, provide the following prompt:

```
Create a single file named ‚ÄúDOC_Approved‚Äù using the content from {{state.agent_output}} generated by the previous agent, then upload this file to Google Drive. Once the upload is successfully completed, retrieve the direct sharing link that allows the user to open or download the file. After the upload, display the result in a markdown-formatted widget showing a clear success message with the file name and a clickable link that redirects directly to the uploaded file. The widget should appear as: ‚Äú‚úÖ File successfully saved to Google Drive ‚Äî File Name: DOC_Approved ‚Äî Google Drive Link: Access DOC_Approved‚Äù. If the upload fails, display an appropriate error message instead of the success message.


```

2. Click on **Add Symbol** and add the **user message**
   ![Configure Agent](./images/addusermsg.png)
3. When you click on **Add Context**, pass the `final_response` variable that you created in the Set Variable component
   ![Configure Agent](./images/addusermessage.png)

## Step 6: Create and Add Output Widget

1. On the output, click on **Add Widget**
   ![Configure Agent](./images/widget.png)
2. Click on **Create**
   ![Configure Agent](./images/createwidget.png)
3. Make a widget using the following prompt:

```
Create a widget that confirms a file has been successfully saved to Google Drive. The widget should include a clear success message, display the file name, and provide a clickable link to access the file on Google Drive. 

```

![Configure Agent](./images/img-10.png) 4. Download the widget
![Configure Agent](./images/img-11.png) 5. Upload the widget to the agent
![Configure Agent](./images/createwidget.png)

## Step 9: Test in Preview Section

Now you're ready to test the complete flow:

1. Go to the **Preview** section
2. Enter your query to the orchestrator agent
3. The orchestrator will decide which agent to call (User Research Agent or Market Research Agent)
4. Review the research data generated by the agent
5. Click **Approve** to proceed (or reject to stop the flow)
6. The PRD Agent will convert the research into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document
7. The PRD will be automatically saved to your Google Drive using the Zapier MCP server
8. A success confirmation will be displayed with the custom widget you created

![Configure Agent](./images/img-14.png)
![Configure Agent](./images/img-15.png)
![Configure Agent](./images/img-16.png)

### ‚úÖ Phase 3 Complete!

You've built a complete research-to-PRD pipeline with:

- ‚úì User approval workflow for quality control
- ‚úì PRD Agent for converting research into structured documents
- ‚úì Google Drive integration via Zapier MCP server
- ‚úì Custom widgets for success confirmation
- ‚úì End-to-end automation from query to saved PRD

---

## Phase 4: PRD Agent - Detailed Configuration Reference

**Note:**  
This phase follows the same flow as **Phase 3**. We use the same orchestration flow but add a **PRD Agent** before storing the file to Google Drive.  
If you have already completed Phase 3, most of the setup is already in place.

Before the **Tool Calling Agent**, add a **PRD Agent** and store the PRD Agent‚Äôs response in a new variable (e.g., `prdResponse`).  
Then, add a **User Approval Component**.  
Finally, in the **Tool Calling Agent**, pass the `prdResponse` as the user message to proceed with the process.

![Configure Agent](./images/prdfinal.png)

This section provides detailed reference documentation for the PRD Agent configuration used in Phase 3, Step 4.

### How It Works

The flow from Phase 3 includes:

1. Research agents (Market or User Research) gather data
2. User approves the research
3. **PRD Agent converts research into a Product Requirements Document**
4. PRD is saved to Google Drive via Zapier MCP server

![Configure Agent](./images/prdfinal.png)

### PRD Agent Configuration (Complete Reference)

Below is the complete PRD Agent prompt used in Phase 3, Step 4:

# Important Guidelines

**Evidence-First Approach:**
- Ground every claim in the research data provided
- Use direct quotes when available
- Reference specific competitive insights, user feedback, or market data
- If making an inference, clearly label it as such

**Be Specific and Quantitative:**
- Use numbers, percentages, and metrics from the research
- Set concrete, measurable goals and targets
- Provide specific acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Include realistic timelines based on project scope

**Prioritize Ruthlessly:**
- Use MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Explain why features are prioritized based on research insights
- Focus on MVP and defer nice-to-haves
- Balance user needs with technical feasibility

**Make Assumptions Transparent:**
- If research data is incomplete, make reasonable assumptions
- Document all assumptions clearly in the Assumptions section
- Note which decisions depend on each assumption
- Suggest how to validate assumptions

**Think Cross-Functionally:**
- Address needs of engineering, design, marketing, and leadership
- Include technical considerations for engineers
- Provide UX guidance for designers
- Define success metrics for leadership
- Plan launch activities for marketing

**Be Production-Ready:**
- Output should be polished and professional
- Use clear, concise language
- Format for easy scanning (tables, bullets, headers)
- Include all sections even if brief
- Make it ready to share with stakeholders immediately

# Output Requirements

1. **Always output the complete Markdown PRD** following the structure above
2. **Fill in ALL sections** with content based on the research data
3. **Link every requirement and recommendation back to research evidence**
4. **Make it actionable** - teams should know exactly what to build and why
5. **Keep it professional** - ready to present to executives or customers

# Example Output Quality

**Good Requirement:**
- **FR-01**: Implement single sign-on (SSO) authentication
  - Priority: Must
  - Rationale: Research showed 67% of enterprise users require SSO for security compliance. Competitor analysis revealed all top 5 competitors offer this feature.
  - Acceptance Criteria: ‚úì Supports SAML 2.0, ‚úì 2-second max login time, ‚úì Works with Okta, Azure AD, Google

**Poor Requirement:**
- Add login feature (too vague, no evidence, no criteria)

# Final Reminders

- Base everything on the research data provided to you
- Create a complete, professional PRD that cross-functional teams can immediately use
- Make requirements specific, measurable, and testable
- Link all decisions back to research evidence
- Document assumptions clearly
- Prioritize based on impact and feasibility
- Output production-ready documentation
```

### Model Configuration Recommendations

For the PRD Agent (configured in Phase 3, Step 4), it's recommended to:

1. Use a model that has reasoning capabilities (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-5, or o1)
2. Configure the model settings with higher token limits to accommodate detailed PRD outputs
3. Optionally add the **Web Search** tool in the **Tools** section if you want the PRD Agent to gather additional context

### Complete Flow Summary

The complete flow in Phase 3:

1. **User Query** ‚Üí Orchestrator Agent decides routing
2. **Research Agent** (Market or User Research) gathers data ‚Üí stored in `research_data` variable
3. **User Approval** ‚Üí User reviews research findings
4. **PRD Agent** ‚Üí Converts research to comprehensive PRD document ‚Üí stored in `final_response` variable
5. **Zapier Agent** ‚Üí Saves PRD to Google Drive
6. **Widget** ‚Üí Displays success confirmation

For complete step-by-step implementation, refer back to **Phase 3**.

## Phase 5: Integrating a Custom Frontend

In this final phase, we will connect the agent to a **custom frontend website** using ChatKit, allowing you to deploy the agent with a fully customized user interface.

## Step 1: Publish Your Workflow and Get Workflow ID

1. In the Agent Builder, click on **Publish** to publish your workflow

   ![Publish Workflow](./images/img-31.png)

2. Once published, click on the **Code** button

   ![Code Button](./images/img-33.png)

3. Copy the **Workflow ID** that is displayed

   ![Copy Workflow ID](./images/img-32.png)

## Step 2: Clone the ChatKit Repository

1. Clone the ChatKit starter template repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-chatkit-starter-app
   ```

2. Open the cloned repository in your code editor (we will be using **Cursor**)

   ![Open in Cursor](./images/img-21.png)

3. Navigate to the project directory

   ![Project Directory](./images/img-22.png)

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

![Install Dependencies](./images/img-23.png)

## Step 4: Create Your Environment File

Copy the example file and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You can get your workflow ID from the [Agent Builder](https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder) interface, after clicking "Publish".

## Step 5: Configure ChatKit Credentials

Update `.env.local` with the variables that match your setup:

- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** ‚Äî This must be an API key created **within the same org & project as your Agent Builder**. If you already have a different `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable set in your terminal session, that one will take precedence over the key in `.env.local` (this is how a Next.js app works). So, **please run `unset OPENAI_API_KEY` (`set OPENAI_API_KEY=` for Windows OS) beforehand**.

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID`** ‚Äî This is the ID of the workflow you created in [Agent Builder](https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder), which starts with `wf_...`

> **Note:** If your workflow is using a model requiring organization verification, such as GPT-5, make sure you verify your organization first. Visit your [organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general) and click on "Verify Organization".

![Configure Environment Variables](./images/img-24.png)

## Step 6: Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and start chatting. Use the prompts on the start screen to verify your workflow connection, then customize the UI or prompt list in `lib/config.ts` and `components/ChatKitPanel.tsx`.
