## Lab Overview

This lab is divided into **3 phases**:

### Phase 1: Publishing Your Workflow

In this phase, you'll:

- Publish your complete agent workflow
- Obtain the workflow ID for frontend integration
- Prepare your workflow for production deployment

### Phase 2: Setting Up ChatKit Development Environment

In this phase, you'll:

- Clone the ChatKit starter template
- Set up your development environment
- Install required dependencies

### Phase 3: Configuring and Deploying Your Frontend

In this final phase, you'll:

- Configure ChatKit with your workflow ID
- Customize the user interface
- Deploy your agent with a custom frontend

---

## Phase 1: Publishing Your Workflow

In this phase, you'll publish your complete agent workflow and obtain the necessary credentials for frontend integration.

### Step 1: Publish Your Workflow

1. Navigate to your **Agent Builder** dashboard
2. Open the workflow you created in **Lab 3** (the one with guardrails and response evaluation)
3. Click on **Publish** to publish your workflow

### Step 2: Get Your Workflow ID

1. Once published, click on the **Code** button

![Code Button](./images/img-33.png)

2. Copy the **Workflow ID** that is displayed (it will start with `wf_`)

### Step 3: Verify Organization Settings

If your workflow uses a model requiring organization verification (such as GPT-5):

1. Visit your [organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general)
2. Click on "Verify Organization"
3. Complete the verification process

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete!

You've successfully published your workflow and obtained the necessary credentials:

- ‚úì **Published Workflow**: Your agent is ready for frontend integration
- ‚úì **Workflow ID**: Unique identifier for ChatKit integration
- ‚úì **Organization Verified**: Ready for advanced model usage

---

## Phase 2: Setting Up ChatKit Development Environment

In this phase, you'll set up your development environment and prepare ChatKit for integration with your agent workflow.

### Step 1: Clone the ChatKit Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Clone the ChatKit starter template repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-chatkit-starter-app
```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd openai-chatkit-starter-app
```

### Step 2: Open in Your Code Editor

1. Open the project in your preferred code editor (we recommend **Cursor** or **VS Code**)

![Open in Cursor](./images/img-21.png)

2. You should see the project structure with files like:
   - `package.json`
   - `lib/config.ts`
   - `components/ChatKitPanel.tsx`
   - `.env.example`

![Project Directory](./images/img-22.png)

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

1. In your terminal, run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

![Install Dependencies](./images/img-23.png)

2. Wait for the installation to complete

### Step 4: Create Environment File

1. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

2. This creates a local environment file where you'll add your credentials

### ‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete!

You've successfully set up your ChatKit development environment:

- ‚úì **Repository Cloned**: ChatKit starter template ready
- ‚úì **Dependencies Installed**: All required packages installed
- ‚úì **Environment File Created**: Ready for configuration

---

## Phase 3: Configuring and Deploying Your Frontend

In this final phase, you'll configure ChatKit with your workflow and deploy your custom frontend.

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env.local` file in your code editor
2. Add the following variables:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key (must be from the same org as your Agent Builder)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Your Workflow ID from Phase 1
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID=wf_your_workflow_id_here
```

**Important Notes:**

- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Must be created within the same organization as your Agent Builder
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID`**: The workflow ID you copied in Phase 1
- If you have an existing `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your terminal, unset it first:
  - **Windows**: `set OPENAI_API_KEY=`
  - **Mac/Linux**: `unset OPENAI_API_KEY`

![Configure Environment Variables](./images/img-24.png)

### Step 2: Customize Your Frontend (Optional)

1. **Customize the UI**: Edit `lib/config.ts` to modify:

   - Welcome messages

2. **Test Full Flow**: Try queries that trigger your complete workflow:
   - Market research queries
   - User research queries
   - PRD generation requests
3. **Check Integration**: Verify that:
   - Guardrails are working
   - Response evaluation is functioning
   - Google Drive integration is saving files
   - Widgets are displaying correctly
